Why do we need OOP?
- Reusability

OOP
- imagine running restaurant 
- reception
- order: waiter 
- chef
- cleaner

One man restaurant (limitation)
- complex and hard to manage
- hire bunch of people, waiter, chef, cleaner
- become manager

How to Use OOP

Model: waiter
has:
is_holding_plate = True
tables_responsible = [4, 5, 6]
-attribute

does:
def take_order(table, order): #takes order to chef
def take_payment(amount) #add money to restaurant
-methods

- Generate model of same type, generate multiple version of same object
- Generate as many as you want from same blue print

Class
waiter

object
Waiter1: Henry
Waiter2: Sara

Constructing Object and Accessing their Attribute and Methods
Example1:
Class(blueprint)
Object

car = CarBlueprint()
object  Class
